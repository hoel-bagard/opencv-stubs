    @brief Calculates a global motion orientation in a selected region.

    @param mhi Motion history image calculated by updateMotionHistory .

    The function calculates an average motion direction in the selected region and returns the angle
    between 0 degrees and 360 degrees. The average direction is computed from the weighted orientation
    histogram, where a recent motion has a larger weight and the motion occurred in the past has a
    smaller weight, as recorded in mhi .

    @brief Calculates a gradient orientation of a motion history image.

    @param mhi Motion history single-channel floating-point image.
    @param mask Output mask image that has the type CV_8UC1 and the same size as mhi . Its non-zero
    elements mark pixels where the motion gradient data is correct.
    @param orientation Output motion gradient orientation image that has the same type and the same
    size as mhi . Each pixel of the image is a motion orientation, from 0 to 360 degrees.
    @param delta1 Minimal (or maximal) allowed difference between mhi values within a pixel
    neighborhood.
    @param delta2 Maximal (or minimal) allowed difference between mhi values within a pixel
    neighborhood. That is, the function finds the minimum ( \f$m(x,y)\f$ ) and maximum ( \f$M(x,y)\f$ ) mhi
    values over \f$3 \times 3\f$ neighborhood of each pixel and marks the motion orientation at \f$(x, y)\f$

    \f[\min ( \texttt{delta1}  ,  \texttt{delta2}  )  \le  M(x,y)-m(x,y)  \le   \max ( \texttt{delta1}  , \texttt{delta2} ).\f]
    @param apertureSize Aperture size of the Sobel operator.

    The function calculates a gradient orientation at each pixel \f$(x, y)\f$ as:

    \f[\texttt{orientation} (x,y)= \arctan{\frac{d\texttt{mhi}/dy}{d\texttt{mhi}/dx}}\f]

    In fact, fastAtan2 and phase are used so that the computed angle is measured in degrees and covers
    the full range 0..360. Also, the mask is filled to indicate pixels where the computed angle is
    valid.

    The function finds all of the motion segments and marks them in segmask with individual values
    (1,2,...). It also computes a vector with ROIs of motion connected components. After that the motion
    direction for every component can be calculated with calcGlobalOrientation using the extracted mask
