    The function applies bilateral filtering to the input image, as described in

    bilateralFilter can reduce unwanted noise very well while keeping edges fairly sharp. However, it is
    very slow compared to most filters.

    _Sigma values_: For simplicity, you can set the 2 sigma values to be the same. If they are small (\<
    10), the filter will not have much effect, whereas if they are large (\> 150), they will have a very
    strong effect, making the image look "cartoonish".

    _Filter size_: Large filters (d \> 5) are very slow, so it is recommended to use d=5 for real-time
    applications, and perhaps d=9 for offline applications that need heavy noise filtering.

    This filter does not work inplace.
